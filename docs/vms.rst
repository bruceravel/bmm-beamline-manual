IOCs on Virtual Machines
========================

As of February 2026, most IOCs at BMM are running on centrally
maintained virtual machines.  The prior IOC server, ``xf06bm-ioc2``,
is still there and can be fallen back upon should that be needed.

This section documents which IOC is running on which VM server.

Detectors: xf06bm-det-ioc1
--------------------------

=============== =======================================================
 IOC Name        Purpose
=============== =======================================================
 eiger-det1      Eiger4 area detector
 mythen-det2     Mythen strip detector
 |simdet|        :strike:`simulated detector` (deprecated)
 xs3-4-1         XSpress3X with calibration for the 4-element detector
 xs3-7-1         XSpress3X with calibration for the 7-element detector
 xs3-8ch         generic XSpress3 
=============== =======================================================

.. note:: The Pilatus100k IOC needs to move from ``xf06bm-ioc1`` to
          ``xf06bm-det-ioc1``

.. admonition:: Future Tech!
		
   MC10 will be the next motor controller for the XAS end station,
   should it be needed


Cameras: xf06bm-cam-ioc1
------------------------


=============== =======================================================
 IOC Name        Purpose
=============== =======================================================
axis-caproto-5   XRD webcam controller
axis-caproto-6   XAS webcam controller
cam01            DM1 beam diagnostic
cam02            DM2 beam diagnostic

cam04            ???
cam07            unused prosilica
cam08            Mako gigE camera (XAS end station)
=============== =======================================================


.. admonition:: Future Tech!

   cam9 - cam11 to replace USB cameras at both end stations

   cam07 will be used with the direct beam sensor for goniometer
   alignment once that item is procured

.. note:: The ``logitechF710`` IOC continues to run on ``xf06bm-ioc2``
	  for now.  It might be moved to a meerkat.  It requires a USB
	  connection, which precludes running on a VM.
